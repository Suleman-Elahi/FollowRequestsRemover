# FollowRequestsRemover

Remove sent follow requests on Instagram with this tool here. May not work while removing large number of requests, but can try by changing the sleep interval from 5 to 10 seconds or more.

**Created for learning and experimenting**. A lot of things need polishing and there is a lot of room for the improvement as well, so PRs are welcome.

## Binary Releases:

Self-contained binary releases can be downloaded from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Suleman-Elahi/FollowRequestsRemover/releases). Just download and run them without installing Python or dependencies mentioned above.
